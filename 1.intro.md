# server side scripting 
Backend development, also known as server-side development, refers to the creation and management of the technology and logic that powers the functionality of web and mobile applications behind the scenes. It focuses on data processing, business logic, and the interaction between the frontend (user-facing interface) and the server/databases.

# Node.js 
Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.

# Express Web Framework

Express is a popular web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js runtime environment. 

Express is the most popular Node.js web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node.js frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
- Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

# Database
A database is a structured collection of data that's stored electronically and organized for easy access and management.

A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data. 

It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files.

 You can use software called a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, and edit data.

# MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents

MongoDB Overview

Document-Oriented: Stores data in JSON-like documents.

Schema-less: No predefined schema, allowing for flexible and dynamic data structures.

Scalable: Designed to scale horizontally with sharding.


High Performance: Optimized for read and write operations.


## MongoDB Atlas 
For this project we will use MongoDb Atlas 

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based, fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) provided by MongoDB, Inc.. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling MongoDB databases in the cloud. With Atlas, developers can focus on building applications rather than worrying about infrastructure and database maintenance.


### How to Get Started with MongoDB Atlas
Sign Up:

Create an account at MongoDB Atlas.

Create a Cluster:

Choose a cluster type (shared, dedicated, or serverless).
Select a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and a region.

Whitelist IP Address:

Add your local machine's IP address or a range of addresses that can access the database.

Connect to Your Cluster:

Use the connection string provided in the Atlas dashboard to connect to your cluster.

.env->

```js
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://Arshad_Faraz_Usmani:your-password@backendlearning.dus8u.mongodb.net

```
Can be eccess using 
```js
const db_uri=Process.env.MONGO_URI
```


## Mongoose 


Mongoose is described as “
elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
”

Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling)/ORM(Object Relational Mapping) library for MongoDB.

 ### Why Mongoose?
By default, MongoDB has a flexible data model. This makes MongoDB databases very easy to alter and update in the future. But a lot of developers are accustomed to having rigid schemas. Mongoose forces a semi-rigid schema from the beginning. With Mongoose, developers must define a Schema and Model.

Using Mongoose or any other ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library, such as Sequelize for SQL databases, provides numerous benefits when working with databases in modern application development. Here's why you should consider using Mongoose or an equivalent ODM:

1. Schema Definition & Data Modeling
Why? MongoDB is schema-less, but in most applications, your data follows a predictable structure.

Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your data, providing structure and validation.

This makes it easier to enforce consistency across your database records.

Without an ODM, you'd need to manually validate and enforce schemas in your codebase.
