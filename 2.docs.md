# docs 
Here is the step by step guide for the project 

# 1.Project setup
Initialise a node project 

Terminal command :
```
npm init 
```
This will initalise a node project and will crate a package.json file .

### package.json
The package.json file is a crucial part of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version, and other configurations


# 2.DB connection 
1. create a cluster on MongoDb Atlas and get the connection string and paste in your .env file 

```js
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://arshadfarazusmani:<db_password>@cluster0.ymfqj.mongodb.net/
```
2. create file constant.js and define Db name
and export  

```js
// constant.js 
const DB_name="videoTube_DB"
export {DB_name}  // we can import where ever needed inside the project 

```
## 3. DB_connection logic 
create a file (src/db/db.js) .
 
### 0. install mongoose 
```
npm i mongoose 
```

## [Src/db/db.js]
### Important points :
- DB connection task is time taking and error prone so alwayes use async await for asyncronus exicution of the Db connection program/code . And also wrap the code inside try catch .

(The code in the try block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed.)


## source code 

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import {DB_name} from '../constant.js';

const DB_URI=process.env.MongoDB_URI

const DB_connect= async ()=>{
    try {
        const connectionInstance= await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`)
        console.log(`Database connected to ${connectionInstance.connection.name}`);

        
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('DB_connect error:',error)
        process.exit(1)
        
    }
}

export {DB_connect}
```
## Source-code-break-down

## 1. importing required modules 
```js
import mongoose from "mongoose"; 
import {DB_name} from "../constants.js" 
```
A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function or import 

    mongoose -> Node module 

    DB_name -> user defined module 

## 2. getting DB_URI from .env 

```js
const DB_URI=process.env.MONGO_URI

```

## 3. writing DB connection logic .

point to concider, use async await  for asyncronus exicution and try catch for exception handling 

The provided code defines an asynchronous function connectDB that attempts to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the code:
```js
const connectDB= async function(){  // function definition 
   try{
    const connectionInstance= await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`)
    console.log("Database connected successfully to", connectionInstance.connection.name)
   }catch(error){
    console.log("DB connection Error !!!",error)
    process.exit(1);

   }
};

```
### 1. Function Definition:
```js
const connectDB = async function() {};
```
Defines an asynchronous function named connectDB.

### 2. Try Block:

try Block: Contains code that attempts to connect to the database.

```js
try {
    const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`);
    console.log("Database connected successfully to", connectionInstance.connection.name);
}

```

await mongoose.connect(...): Uses Mongoose's connect method to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. The connection string is constructed using template literals, combining DB_URI and DB_name.



DB_URI: The base URI for the MongoDB server

### 3. Catch Block:

```js
 catch (error) {
    console.log("DB connection Error !!!", error);
    process.exit(1);
}
```
catch Block: Executes if an error occurs during the connection attempt.

console.log(...): Logs an error message to the console, including the error details.

process.exit(1): Exits the Node.js process with a status code of 1, indicating an error.

### 4 Exporting the module 

```js
export {connectDB};
```
we can import ConnectDB wherever we need to connect Db .

### 5 Purpose:
Asynchronous Connection: The function uses async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the database connection.

Error Handling: The try/catch block ensures that any errors during the connection attempt are caught and logged, and the process exits gracefully if a connection cannot be established.

Logging: Provides informative messages about the success or failure of the database connection.

In summary, the connectDB function is designed to establish a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, handle any potential errors, and log the outcome to the console.



# 3. creating Express Application  
we will create express app inside new file app.js inside source directory 

The provided code snippet is setting up a basic Express application and exporting it for use in other parts of the project. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:
```js
import express from "express"; // import express module to create express application
const app = express(); // create an instance of an Express application

export { app }; // export the app instance

```

 ### Key Features of an Express App:

#### Middleware:

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Middleware can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.

#### Routing:

An Express app provides a robust routing mechanism to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs.

Routes are defined using methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc

#### Configuration:

An Express app can be configured with various settings and options using methods like app.set() and app.get().


#### Error Handling:

An Express app can define error-handling middleware to manage errors that occur during the request-response cycle.

#### Templating:

An Express app can be configured to use templating engines like Pug, EJS, etc., to render dynamic HTML pages.
