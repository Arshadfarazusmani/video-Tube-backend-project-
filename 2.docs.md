# docs 
Here is the step by step guide for the project 

# 1.Project setup
Initialise a node project 

Terminal command :
```
npm init 
```
This will initalise a node project and will crate a package.json file .

### package.json
The package.json file is a crucial part of any Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version, and other configurations


# 2.DB connection 
1. create a cluster on MongoDb Atlas and get the connection string and paste in your .env file 

```js
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://arshadfarazusmani:<db_password>@cluster0.ymfqj.mongodb.net/
```
2. create file constant.js and define Db name
and export  

```js
// constant.js 
const DB_name="videoTube_DB"
export {DB_name}  // we can import where ever needed inside the project 

```
## 3. DB_connection logic 
create a file (src/db/db.js) .
 
### 0. install mongoose 
```
npm i mongoose 
```

## [Src/db/db.js]
### Important points :
- DB connection task is time taking and error prone so alwayes use async await for asyncronus exicution of the Db connection program/code . And also wrap the code inside try catch .

(The code in the try block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed.)


## source code 

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import {DB_name} from '../constant.js';

const DB_URI=process.env.MongoDB_URI

const DB_connect= async ()=>{
    try {
        const connectionInstance= await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`)
        console.log(`Database connected to ${connectionInstance.connection.name}`);

        
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('DB_connect error:',error)
        process.exit(1)
        
    }
}

export {DB_connect}
```
## Source-code-break-down

## 1. importing required modules 
```js
import mongoose from "mongoose"; 
import {DB_name} from "../constants.js" 
```
A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function or import 

    mongoose -> Node module 

    DB_name -> user defined module 

## 2. getting DB_URI from .env 

```js
const DB_URI=process.env.MONGO_URI

```

## 3. writing DB connection logic .

point to concider, use async await  for asyncronus exicution and try catch for exception handling 

The provided code defines an asynchronous function connectDB that attempts to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the code:
```js
const connectDB= async function(){  // function definition 
   try{
    const connectionInstance= await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`)
    console.log("Database connected successfully to", connectionInstance.connection.name)
   }catch(error){
    console.log("DB connection Error !!!",error)
    process.exit(1);

   }
};

```
### 1. Function Definition:
```js
const connectDB = async function() {};
```
Defines an asynchronous function named connectDB.

### 2. Try Block:

try Block: Contains code that attempts to connect to the database.

```js
try {
    const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`);
    console.log("Database connected successfully to", connectionInstance.connection.name);
}

```

await mongoose.connect(...): Uses Mongoose's connect method to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. The connection string is constructed using template literals, combining DB_URI and DB_name.



DB_URI: The base URI for the MongoDB server

### 3. Catch Block:

```js
 catch (error) {
    console.log("DB connection Error !!!", error);
    process.exit(1);
}
```
catch Block: Executes if an error occurs during the connection attempt.

console.log(...): Logs an error message to the console, including the error details.

process.exit(1): Exits the Node.js process with a status code of 1, indicating an error.

### 4 Exporting the module 

```js
export {connectDB};
```
we can import ConnectDB wherever we need to connect Db .

### 5 Purpose:
Asynchronous Connection: The function uses async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the database connection.

Error Handling: The try/catch block ensures that any errors during the connection attempt are caught and logged, and the process exits gracefully if a connection cannot be established.

Logging: Provides informative messages about the success or failure of the database connection.

In summary, the connectDB function is designed to establish a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, handle any potential errors, and log the outcome to the console.



# 3. creating Express Application  

#### Express Application ->  The app object conventionally denotes the Express application.

This object, which is traditionally named app, has methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering HTML views, registering a template engine, and modifying application settings that control how the application behaves (e.g. the environment mode, whether route definitions are case sensitive, etc.)

we will create express app inside new file app.js inside source directory 

The provided code snippet is setting up a basic Express application and exporting it for use in other parts of the project. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:
```js
import express from "express"; // import express module to create express application
const app = express(); // create an instance of an Express application

export { app }; // export the app instance

```

 ### Key Features of an Express App:

#### Middleware:

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Middleware can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.

#### Routing:

An Express app provides a robust routing mechanism to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs.

Routes are defined using methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc

#### Configuration:

An Express app can be configured with various settings and options using methods like app.set() and app.get().


#### Error Handling:

An Express app can define error-handling middleware to manage errors that occur during the request-response cycle.

#### Templating:

An Express app can be configured to use templating engines like Pug, EJS, etc., to render dynamic HTML pages.

# 4 Initiate the server and connect to the database
create index.js inside src 
## source code 
```js
// Initiate the server and connect to the database

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config(
   {
    path: '/.env'
   }
);
import { app } from './app.js';
import { DB_connect } from './db/db.js';

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;

DB_connect().then(() => {

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        res.send("Hello world!");
    });


  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
  });
}).catch((err) => { console.log("Database connection error",err); });
```



## 1. import and config dot env 

```js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config(
   {
    path: '/.env'
   }
);
```
### dotenv

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env

Enable  Storing configuration in the environment separate from code

## 2. import DB_name and DB_connect function 

```js
import { app } from './app.js';
import { DB_connect } from './db/db.js';
```

## 3. Create port 
```js
PORT=process.env.PORT||3000;
```

## 4.calling DB_connect 

```js
DB_connect().then(()=>{
    // do somthing if resolve 
}).catch((err)=>{
    console.log("DB connection Error")
})
```
-> ConnectDB()-> async function and async always returns a prommise 
Declaring a function with the async keyword means that the function will always return a promise. 

If the function returns a value, the promise resolves with that value; if an error is thrown, the promise rejects with that error.

we know that resolve -> then ; reject-> catch 

if the db connection fail the catch block code will exicute an show error 

if the is successfully connect then ,then block code will exicute 

## 5.servr creation 

```js
.then(()=>{
    app.listen(PORT,()=>{
        console.log("server is running on ",PORT)
    })
})
```
### package.json 
```js
"dev" : "nodemon -r dotenv/config src/index.js"
```
terminal command  :

    npm run dev 

    <!-- Out put  -->
    Database connected to videoTube_DB
    Server is running on port 8000

### successfully crated the server !!!

# Express app configurations 

The configurations added to your Express application in 

app.js

```js
import express from "express"; // import express module to create express application
const app = express(); // create an instance of an Express application

//  configuring app to use cors middleware.

app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true
    
}));
// configuring app to use json middleware.
app.use(express.json({
    limit: '16kb'
}));
// configuring app to use urlencoded middleware.
app.use(express.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
    limit: '16kb'
}));
// configuring app to use static middleware.
// serve static files from the 'public' directory.

app.use(express.static('public'));


// configuring app to use cookie-parser middleware.
// cookie-parser is used to parse cookies attached to the client request object.

app.use(cookieParser());

export  {app}; // export the app object to be used in other modules.
```

 are essential for handling various aspects of HTTP requests and responses. Here's a detailed explanation of each configuration and why they are important:

### 1. CORS Middleware:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true
}));
```
- **Purpose**: The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware allows your server to handle requests from different origins (domains). This is crucial for enabling web applications running on different domains to access your API.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN

: Specifies the allowed origin(s) for cross-origin requests. The value is taken from an environment variable 

CORS_ORIGIN

.
  - 

credentials: true

: Allows cookies and HTTP authentication information to be included in cross-origin requests.

### 2. JSON Middleware:
```javascript
app.use(express.json({
    limit: '16kb'
}));
```
- **Purpose**: The JSON middleware parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the parsed data available in `req.body`. This is essential for handling POST, PUT, and PATCH requests where the client sends data in JSON format.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

limit: '16kb'

: Sets the maximum size of the JSON payload that the middleware will accept. This helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting the size of incoming JSON data.

### 3. URL-encoded Middleware:
```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
    limit: '16kb'
}));
```
- **Purpose**: The URL-encoded middleware parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (typically sent by HTML forms) and makes the parsed data available in `req.body`.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

extended: true

: Uses the `qs` library to parse URL-encoded data, allowing for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format.
  - 

limit: '16kb'

: Sets the maximum size of the URL-encoded payload that the middleware will accept, similar to the JSON middleware.

### 4. Static Middleware:
```javascript
// serve static files from the 'public' directory.
app.use(express.static('public'));
```
- **Purpose**: The static middleware serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets from the specified directory. This is essential for serving client-side resources.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

express.static('public')

: Specifies the `public` directory as the location from which to serve static files.

### Summary:
- **CORS Middleware**: Enables cross-origin requests, allowing your API to be accessed from different domains.
- **JSON Middleware**: Parses JSON payloads in incoming requests, making it easier to handle JSON data.
- **URL-encoded Middleware**: Parses URL-encoded payloads, typically from HTML forms, making it easier to handle form data.
- **Static Middleware**: Serves static files from the specified directory, providing client-side resources like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

These configurations are essential for building a robust and secure Express application that can handle various types of requests and serve necessary resources to clients.
